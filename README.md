# CryptoApp

Crypto Currency application build in Android Studio using Kotlin. This is my favorite project that I've built! 
The first page displays the list of the top coins in the market. When the user clicks a coin, they are brought to the selected coins detail page where they can view the current data on that coin.

- MVVM
- Clean Architecture for scalability and ease of testing
- Retrofit for the API call
- Hilt for dependency injection
- Jetpack Compose framework for the UI

Tests are still in progress!
