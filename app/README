        Having some issues learning to write tests. Made some notes!

        Learning about MockK and Mockito to solve some of these issues.
        Been having a lot of fun with this!

        Issues/Questions:

        - I think some of my end-to-end tests may actually be integration tests?

        - How to test network error?

        - Organizing tests into separated inner classes throws errors.

        - Tests for the explore and social media links are not showing up in the semantics tree,
          and are failing isDisplayed tests but are obviously displayed when manual testing and
          they pass assertExists.. weird.

        - isNotDisplayed tests still fail after collapsing card and text is not displayed. confused.

        - Issue sharing fakes/test-doubles between androidTest and test packages


        - Data models from production code are used in fakes, so when using a separate
          library module containing the fake data, and then importing that library module to share
          between packages, the separate library module can't see the models within the production
          code.

          Maybe I can mock the models with MockK or Mockito or something?
          Or maybe there's a way to get the library module to share those data models and DTOs?


        - Need to figure out how to test the progress bar :)

        - Is there a way to separate the Test Rules into a separate file to share between tests?
          Don't want to have keep writing those for each test if I don't have to.
